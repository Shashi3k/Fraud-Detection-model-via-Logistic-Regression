Credit Card Fraud Detection 🛡️💳
Overview
This project implements a Credit Card Fraud Detection model using logistic regression. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

Workflow
Data Source: Utilized Kaggle's credit card dataset.
Pre-processing: Balanced the data to address class imbalance.
Analysis: Explored data insights to inform modeling.
Train-Test Split: Ensured model reliability through strategic data partitioning.
Model Training: Logistic regression yielded exceptional results, achieving over 92% accuracy on both training and testing data, mitigating overfitting and underfitting risks.
